          <p>
            When our first child turned 3, we faced something we didn't expect.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We wanted to raise our children on <strong>Quran and Sunnah</strong>. We wanted them to love Allah, remember Him in everything they did, and understand His beautiful names and attributes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But there was a problem.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Everywhere we looked, we saw screens. YouTube videos. Cartoons. Apps. Our children were drawn to them like magnets. And while some content was "Islamic," most of it was just... entertainment.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>We wanted less screen time. We wanted our children attached to books.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So we searched. We looked for Islamic books that would engage young minds. Books that would teach them to <strong>reflect</strong> on Allah's creation, not just memorize facts.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            What we found disappointed us.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Most books were general knowledge with an "Islamic" label slapped on. Or they mixed culture with religion. Or they were boring textbooks that even we didn't want to read.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>None of them taught Tadabbur—deep reflection on Allah's words and creation.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We realized something: If we couldn't find what we needed... maybe it didn't exist yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            We were homeschooling our two children. And as any homeschooling parent knows, you quickly realize: <strong>You're not just a teacher. You're a curriculum creator.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            One day, our children challenged us.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Not with words, but with their eyes. The way they looked at the books we brought them. The way they got distracted. The way they didn't connect.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That's when we understood: <strong>If we wanted something different for our children, we had to create it ourselves.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We sat down together—me (Shayan) and my wife (Umm Abdullah)—and asked ourselves:
          </p>
          
          <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-6 rounded-r-2xl">
            <p class="italic text-lg">
              "What do we actually want our children to learn? Not just know... but truly understand and live?"
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            The answer was clear: <strong>We want them to remember Allah in every moment of their day-to-day lives.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Not just during Salah. Not just when reading Quran. But when they see a tree. When they eat food. When they play. When they sleep.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We wanted them to see Allah's signs everywhere. To reflect. To connect. To love Him through understanding.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <strong>That's Tadabbur.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And that's what we decided to build.

              <p class="text-gray-600">The Book Creator</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            My wife, Umm Abdullah, took on the books. Not because of her Masters degree in English Literature (though that helped). But because <strong>she practices Tadabbur in her own life.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Tadabbur changed her. It made her connect to Allah in ways she never thought possible. She wanted that for our children. For all Muslim children.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But there was a challenge: <strong>How do you teach Tadabbur—something adults struggle with—to children?</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            She spent months figuring it out. Testing with our kids. Watching what made their eyes light up. What made them ask questions. What made them remember Allah naturally.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The answer? <strong>Make it interactive. Make it visual. Make it from their perspective.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That's how our first book was born: <em>"Who Made All This?"</em>—following a curious ladybug discovering Allah's creation, with flaps to lift, dhikr to recite, and questions that make children think.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Every page was designed to help children <strong>reflect, not just read.</strong>

                  <p class="text-gray-600">The Quran Teacher</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              
              <p>
                I (Shayan) took on the lessons. In 2021, I completed memorizing the Quran—a journey that changed my life. But memorization was just the beginning.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>I wanted to understand what I memorized. I wanted to live it.</strong>
              </p>
            </div>
            
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Teaching our own children taught me something I never learned in any class: <strong>Patience. Love. Meeting them where they are.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I realized that children aren't small adults. They learn differently. They need you to speak their language, not force them into yours.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That's when I decided to pursue my <strong>Ijazah from Masjid Nabawi in Madinah</strong>—learning Qaaidah teaching methodology directly from scholars at the Prophet's Mosque ﷺ.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Why Masjid Nabawi? Because I love it. Because learning in the presence of Rasulullah's ﷺ resting place makes everything more meaningful. Because I wanted to teach the way the Sahabah taught their children.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Now, I teach other children the way I teach my own: with <strong>patience, love, and a focus on connection—not just recitation.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Because when children understand <em>why</em> they're reading, they fall in love with the Quran. And that's what we want for every child.

    To help Muslim children remember Allah in every moment of their day-to-day lives.

  <p>

  <p>
    But when they see a bird. When they drink water. When they wake up. When they go to sleep.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>We want children to see Allah's signs everywhere.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's why we created our books. That's why we teach our lessons. That's why TadabburKids exists.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Because when children learn to reflect on Allah's creation, something beautiful happens: <strong>They fall in love with their Creator.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And that love? It stays with them forever.

          </p>
          
          <p>
            We don't know exactly what that will look like yet. We're taking it step by step, trusting Allah to guide us.
